to find out whether you need to install this program. Detailed installation
and configuration procedures can be found in the user help available in the
CHROMELEON Server Configuration utility.

Please note: The Dionex BOOTP Server is NOT LICENSED to be used on systems
not running a CHROMELEON server and may NOT be redistributed freely.
